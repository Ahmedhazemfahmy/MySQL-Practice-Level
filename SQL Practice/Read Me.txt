Here I will be sharing my first SQL Practice as shown. 

You would find the below as headlines what was done and created in the code: 

* Connecting over my localhost and creating the database file

* Creating varoius Tables and using a couple of methods inserting data into the tables

* ALtering and editing in the tables content

* Connecting the table with the 1 to 1 conncetion using the realtion of Foreign Key-Relationship.
